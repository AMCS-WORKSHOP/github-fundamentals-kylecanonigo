## 🤓 About Me

Hi everyone,

My name is Kyle A. Canonigo, and I’m currently in my fourth year studying Computer Science at Cebu Institute of Technology - University.

I’ve always loved staying active—whether it’s running🏃, swimming🏊, or cycling🚴. Sports have been a big part of my life since I was a kid, and I still enjoy them a lot.

When it comes to tech, I’m really into coding and am currently focusing on ASP.NET Core and Angular. I find it exciting to work on new projects and learn new things.

I also enjoy reading whenever I get the chance. It’s a great way for me to relax and explore different ideas.

I’m looking forward to learning and growing, and I’m excited to connect with others who share similar interests.

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! 🤓
